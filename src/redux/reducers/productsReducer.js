 * Implement productsReducer that handles following cases:

 * 4) UPDATE_PRODUCT: Updates the order in the state and places it as its last entry.
 * 5) DELETE_PRODUCT: Deletes the product from the array.
 * 
 * @param {Array} state old state of products.
 * @param {object} action the action that calls the reducer.
 * @returns {Array} new state for products
